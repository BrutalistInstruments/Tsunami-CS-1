## Electronics Components:
The current BOM is held at this mangaged DigiKey shopping cart.
If a part becomes obselete, we'll be updating it here.

In addition to the Digikey cart, You'll also need to source your own Tsunami Wav Trigger, and Arduio mega boards. 
The wav trigger can be had from here, or any sparkfun distributer:

Arduino Mega development boards can be had from a number of sources at a few different price points. (ebay, amazon, official sources, robotics webstores, ect)
This project was developed on Elagoo clones. 
Any clone should get the job done, as long as it has a 16Mhz Crystal Oscillator.
I have seen a few mega clones that have 12Mhz Oscillators, and some with ceramic Oscillators. 
Since timing is extremely important to this code, having the correct clock source is vital.

## Mounting Hardware:
We're currently sourcing all of our mounting hardware from McMaster Carr.
https://www.mcmaster.com/
Parts numbers are as follows:
Screws: 92125A128
Bolts: 90592A085
Standoffs: 98952A106
Screws are hex driven, so any standard allen wrench set should suit you well. 
This project requires 18 standoffs. 
The other packages of 100 screws and nuts should get you though the rest of enclosure, and only run around $4.
