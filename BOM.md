## Electronics Components:
The current BOM is held at this mangaged DigiKey shopping cart.
If a part becomes obselete, we'll be updating it here. 
https://www.digikey.com/short/z5mmrv

In addition to the Digikey cart, You'll also need to source your own Tsunami Wav Trigger, and Arduio mega boards. 
The wav trigger can be had from here, or any sparkfun distributer:
https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13810

Arduino Mega development boards can be had from a number of sources at a few different price points. (ebay, amazon, official sources, robotics webstores, ect)
This project was developed on Elagoo clones. 
Any clone should get the job done, as long as it has a 16Mhz Crystal Oscillator.
I have seen a few mega clones that have 12Mhz Oscillators, and some with ceramic Oscillators. 
Since timing is extremely important to this code, having the correct clock source is vital.

## Mounting Hardware:
We're currently sourcing all of our mounting hardware from McMaster Carr.
https://www.mcmaster.com/
Parts numbers are as follows:
Screws (short, for frontpannel mounting): 92125A128
Screws (longer, for sidepannels): 92125A132
Bolts: 90592A085
Standoffsx18: 98952A106
Standoffs for OLED Screenx4: 98952A103 
Screws are hex driven, so any standard allen wrench set should suit you well. 
This project requires 18 standoffs. 
The other packages of 100 screws and nuts should get you though the rest of enclosure, and only run around $4. 


# Notes
-Currently, it looks like digikey and mouser are both out of the required audio jacks. 
It looks like this is a suitable drop in replacement:https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Amphenol-Audio/ACJM-HHDR?qs=t8%2F5FiDdxGZR4gBVKrXjqA%3D%3D
